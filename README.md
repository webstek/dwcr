# The D Watercolour Renderer Project

A project that aims to render 3d scenes in the style of a watercolour painting using the D language and minimal libraries. The only library it uses is bindbc-sdl for interfacing with the C-based SDL library to create the application window and to process user inputs.

#### Current Work:
- Importing geometry data from .obj files
- Writing software rendering code
  - Get a basic window to show with nothing rendered


#### Future Work:
- Rasterizing a triangle
  - Math backend
- camera controls
- Watercolour Simulation
  - rendering from textures
